# Game Plan

## Initial plan

Initial plan to get a fully working but basic game, this will be the **MPV** ([Minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)).

> A minimum viable product (MVP) is a version of a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

Getting a minimum viable product will mean that at a relatively early stage we will have a working game to demo that we can then work on adding additional features to. We may choose to change what we define as the MVP and during development we can decide on which features to add in which order.

Once we have this version 1.0 fully working we can make additions and improvements to the game to achieve extra marks 

### The MVP

A flat world where the player(s) can move side to side, aim their turret, and shoot projectiles that will follow the correct path.

There will be at least one AI tank - this could be a single player option.

Sound will play when tanks are hit.

There will be a scoring system to the game - each player could have health or points?

The game could actually be turn based if we make it difficult and 'skilful' to aim the projectile.

I think for the game to be more enjoyable the pase will have to be relatively slow. If the players can just 'spam' firing and move quickly to avoid projectiles it could be difficult. *Hold space bar for longer before release to fire further?*

Database?

if we are happy with this I will make more detailed requirements based on this idea.

## Additional improvement ideas

- tanks could have name-tags and health bars
- the world the tanks are in is not just flat but has varied terrain
- better **artwork** for the game
    - smoke trails and particle effects from projectiles
    - textured ground, perhaps grass on soil?
- players have limited ammo per time
- players could pick up additional ammo
- **points**/upgrades
    - Players could earn money/points to be able to upgrade their tank?
    - can change colour of tank
- Lobby system where players can choose who to battle or what type of battle to have: e.g. 1v1 or 1v1v1v1v1v1v1 or 3v3 etc.
- **physics**:
    - players can change power and projectile their tank uses
    - add wind
    - bombs could effect the shape of the world
    - better movement physics such as momentum, acceleration, friction and gravity to mimic more realistic movement.
- option to customise control, e.g. to connect a game controller to the computer and play with that!
- side scrolling environment
    - with mini-map
