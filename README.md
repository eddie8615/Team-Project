# Game (name TBD)

## How to get started developing the game

**PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR OWN BRANCH FOR THIS BEFORE MERGING TO DEV OR MASTER**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Use IntelliJ or Eclipse to open the cloned folder as a project.
3. The project should load up and Gradle should configure, by downloading lwjgl, etc.
4. Add a run configuration with the main class being org.cauldron.Game.

When you commit changes, remember to push them and merge to dev when needed for more complete experimental features.
For any features needed in a release (demo, final, etc.) merge dev into master.

## To try this game, you need to change directory name to 'cauldron' when you pull or clone this project
